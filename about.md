# About Me
<br>
Hey! I'm Guangrui Wang. I consider myself a software engineer with a passion for full stack development, cloud computing, and distributed systems.
<br>
I was interned at [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)) as Software Development Engineer in the summer of 2023. I worked on the [MDC (Modular Data Center)](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/aws-modular-data-center-mdc-us-department-defense-customers/) team, where I developed a tool for manage and auto-generate the network configuration files for the MDCs. When I was in my undergraduate, I worked with [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI_Inc.) to help develop a web-based system for the company's internal use.
<br>
I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), and I recently graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) with a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
